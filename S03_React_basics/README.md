## Module Introduction

For this module, the main focus would be establishing how to endeavor with:

- **Component-drive user interfaces**: building interactive and scalable UIs

Some key concepts needed onward are **React core syntax & JSX**, also working with **components** and with **data**, which explored even more.

A **project** will be built in the next sections, whose portrayed **purpose** is saving an user's expenses into a interactive _webpage_.

## What Are Components? And Why Is React All About Them?

Building user interfaces are responsabilities of **HTML**, **CSS** and **JS**, but not only to them. That is also the case with React. One simple distinction \[see definitions at [key terms](#key-terms)] is.

> _React \[library\] makes building complex, interactive and reactive user interfaces simpler_.

As it can be seen, React is all about **components** -- all UI are made up of them. They are comparable to _reusable pieces_; basically the main benefits are summed up in:

- **Reusability**: don't repeat yourself
- **Separation of concerns**: avoid doing many things in one and same place (function)

Basically there is a work by **splitting big chunks of code into multiple small functions** for that aims.

## Key terms

Some definitions are very usefully when building React _websites_. They follow:

- **Responsive**: adapting layouts to a variety of screen and window sizes.

- **Interactive**: elements that react to your actions on the site.

- **Reactive**: automatically checking and updating data from the server without refreshing the website.

- **Complex**: composed of different simple elements like our components in a way that it eases the interactions between different parts of our application to drive the business logic of the application.
