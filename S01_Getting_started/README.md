<!-- 2. What is React.js? -->

## What is React.js?

Traditional websites weren't usually "**reactive**". The transitions were not so smooth, for example, but the **request-response cycle** would take a longer time to render dynamic code.

Remember that JavaScript runs in the browser -- on the loaded page.

**React.js** is a JavaScript library.

- A client-side JavaScript library.
- All about building reactive user interfaces for the web

Why using this framework? Check next section.

## Why React Instead Of "Just JavaScript"?

Defining step after step can limit all the needed details -- this is the **imperative approach**. Basically using _React.js_ helps the developer to work on a higher level.

Besides that, _React_ allows splitting up of the code into smaller blocks, which gives an enormous quality to all of the process.

## Building Single-Page Applications (SPAs) with React

React can also be used to **control the entire frontend** of a web application -- SPA. So _React_ takes control over the UI, providing better user experience and smoothness.

That is the most common approach (building **SPA**). For example, changing the page even without reloading it is a big "boost" conferred by the technology.

About React and relation to serve, Prateek writes:

> With React, we get an initial HTML file as response from the server and it is on this HTML file, different views are presented by React. So **React** uses **React** Router which gives an illusion of multiple pages. So essentially you use different routes to load different views and each of those views get rendered or painted on this one single HTML file. So it is the App component that we mount on the HTML file.

<!-- 5. Exploring React.js Alternatives (Angular / Vue) -->

## Exploring React.js Alternatives (Angular / Vue)

There are alternatives to this framework. See the list below. They are sought to improve funcdtionalities; thus, the developers may need to install **3rd. package libraries**.

### Front-end frameworks

- **React.js**: Lean and focused component-based UI library.
  - Certain features (e.g. routing) are added via community packages.
- **Angular**: complete component-based UI framework, packed with features.
  - Uses TypeScript.
  - Can be overkill for smaller project.
- **Vue.js**: similar to a mixture of both.
  - Complete component-based UI framework.
  - Includes most core feaures.
  - A bit less popular than React & Angular.

<!-- 7. About This Course & Course Outline -->

## About This Course & Course Outline

The topics covered in this course are, basically:

- **Basics & Foundation** (_introduccing key features_)
  - components & building UIs
  - working with events & data: "props" and "state"
  - styling react apps & components
  - introduction into "react hooks"
- **Advanced concepts** (_building for production_)
  - side effects, "refs" & more react hooks
  - react's context API & Redux
  - forms, http requests & "custom hooks"
  - routing, deployment, NextJS & more
- **Summaries & refreshers** (_optimizing your time_)
  - JavaScript refresher
  - ReactJS summary _(at the end)_

Obs.: this list is not exaustive. Check the **course overview**. All come together with:

1. theory and small demos & examples,
2. more realistic (bigger) example projects
3. challengs & exercises

<!-- 8. The Two Ways (Paths) Of Taking This Course -->

## The Two Ways (Paths) Of Taking This Course

Approaches are many:

- **Standard Approach**

  - Start with lecture 1 in section 1 and go through the course step by step
  - skip JavaScript refresher module if you don't need it
  - use React summary module at the end to summarize what you learned or to refresh knowledge in the future

- **Summary approach** (_if you're in a hurry_)
  - skip forward to the React summary module
  - optionally also take JavaScdript refresher module if you need it
  - go throught the entire course after going through the summary module and/or if you got more time in the future

<!-- 9. Getting The Most Out Of This Course -->

## How to Get The Most Out Of The Course

- **Watch the videos** (_choose your pace_)
- **Code along & practice** (_also without me telling you_)
- **Debug errors & explore solutions** (_also use code attachmens_)
- **Help each other & learn together** (_dicord, Q&A board_)
